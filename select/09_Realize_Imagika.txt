Blade poised high
Sliced down now your life is sealed
Tormented cry
Blank stare while the skin is peeled

No use crying for you'll never be the same
Dime store junkie when he's high
You'll get erased

Realize your life is ending
Realize do you want to die
Visualize your soul descending
Vaporize into the night

Victim of circumstance
Deliverance is here
Not given a breathing chance
To escape yopur darkest fears

Realize your life is ending
Realize do you want to die
Visualize your soul descending
Vaporize into the night

I'm feeling high
Why can't you see it why?
I'm feeling high
But there's no reply no

Last call user
Brain trippin' gone an' messed your mind
Brain dead loser
Slow death on borrowed time
Show me a habit and I'll show you
Wasted hope
See your last conclusion
Is found at the end of a rope

Realize your life is ending
Realize do you want to die
Visualize your soul descending
Vaporize into the night
