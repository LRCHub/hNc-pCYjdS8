Look into the mirror
And tell me what you see.
Are you free or just
A slave of the authorities?
Don't you ever question
The will that you fulfill?
Don't you ever ask
What's real?

Open up your eyes
Open up your eyes
Break out and live
Come and taste the real life
Open up your mind
Open up your mind
Reach for the truth
Realize the real lies
Open up your eyes
Open up your eyes
Break out and live
Come and taste the real life
Open up your mind
Open up your mind

Weakness kept in silence
No doubtful voice is raised
Throughout this endless crisis
Which no one dares to face
The choking hand of violence
Feeds us rotten thoughts of hate
Don't wait now break the silence
Don't wait ...

Open up your eyes
Open up your eyes
Break out and live
Come and taste the real life
Open up your mind
Open up your mind
Reach for the truth
Realize the real lies
Open up your eyes
Open up your eyes
Break out and live
Come and taste the real life
Open up your mind
Open up your mind

REALIZE THE REAL LIES!!
Open up
Your eyes
Open up
Your mind
Open up your eyes
Open up your mind
START TO REALIZE!!

Open up your eyes
Open up your eyes
REALIZE THE REAL LIES
Open up your mind
Open up your mind
REALIZE THE REAL LIES
Open up your eyes
Open up your eyes
REALIZE THE REAL LIES
Open up your mind
Open up your mind
Realize the real lies...
