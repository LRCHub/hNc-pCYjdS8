You got a lotta nothin'
Somebody's got it all
But you know you deserve somethin'
Workin' all day and all
You've been a loyal worker
Takin' a lot of abuse
Dreamin' about your fortune
So really, it ain't no use

Well, you check out your neighbor
Drivin' his second car
You know that when you're walkin'
Ain't gonna get too far
You're lookin' green with envy
He's got all that extra time
You're workin' fourteen hours
But you barely make a dime

Hoo
Who do you think you are?
Hoo hoo
You'd never get too far
Well, you better realize
Just who and where you are today
Need I say?

Hoo
Who do you think you are?
Hoo hoo
You'd never get too far
But, you better realize
Just who and where you are today
Need I say?

Hoo
Who do you think you are?
Hoo hoo
You're never gonna get too far
You better realize
Just who the hell you are today
Need I say?

It don't understand
You were recording this, weren't you?
That was I think we might have it
